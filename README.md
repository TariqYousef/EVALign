### EVALign: Visual Evaluation of Translation Alignment Models

**EVALign** is a framework for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of automatic translation alignment models. **EVALign** offers several visualization views enabling developers to visualize their models' predictions and compare the performance of their models with other baseline and state-of-the-art models. 
Via different search and filter functions, developers can also inspect the frequent alignment errors and their positions. **EVALign** hosts nine gold standard datasets and the predictions of multiple alignment models. The tool is extendable, and adding additional datasets and models is straightforward. 


_Installation instructions and documentation will be available soon._
